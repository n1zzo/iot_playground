# IoT Playground
## Experiment with ESP32 and Micropython

This repository contains instructions and code examples on the MicroPython framework used on an ESP32 board.

The combination of these two elements allows newcomers to learn and build the Internet of Things using
a simple and coherent platform, yet very powerful.

All the setup instructions and code examples can be found on [the wiki](https://github.com/n1zzo/iot_playground/wiki).
